Resolutions are made when one wants to correct themselves for the mistakes that have done the past years or improvement in learnings or do something in a more organized manner.

Every year I used to plan some resolutions, in which one or two can be done, and sometimes even they break in the middle. I'm annoyed at myself. So this year I didn't make any resolutions. But later I realized that making resolutions is a good move to make ourselves better than before.
So, this year I going to plan some of the resolutions and stick to them.

**My Resolutions List**:
I am a lazy fellow so I want to make myself as busy as possible.
I don't know how to manage things, so I also want to learn management.
I never have the habit of organizing my work and therefore end up in incomplete homework and projects. So this year I plan to be more systematic and organized so that I finish my work on time and do not keep pending, the works assigned to me.
I am not good at maths, So I want to learn and practice more on Aptitude topics.
I also should take care of my family, I should not shout at anybody, should stay calm in hurry situations.
I should improve my speaking and writing skills.
Learn any language mostly Hindi.

This time, I am determined to stick to my resolutions and get myself corrected to be a better person.
