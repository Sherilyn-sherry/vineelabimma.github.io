##How I celebrate Christmas.

Christmas is one of my favorite festivals. I eagerly wait for it. Two days before the Dec month, we start our preparations like making crib, hanging star, cleaning the house, decorating the Christmas tree, the crib, and the house with multicolor serial lights. My street looks very beautiful with colorful lights and stars in front of every house with Christmas vibes. 

In the month of Dec, we do lots of shopping, make some storable snacks, practice dancing, singing, drama, and learn some verses from the Bible related to the event. And also go to church for help with decorations.

All my relatives come to my house one day before or in the morning of the day. We are all involved in cooking a variety of dishes. We visit friends and neighbors and exchange gifts and food items with each other. We go to the church to offer prayers and enjoy singing Christmas carols. At 12 AM we cut the cake as it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus by lit candles in everyone's hands. I wish everyone a Merry Christmas. We will return to our houses from the church by late at night. 

Every year we go to the beach the next day of Christmas, we enjoy it a lot with our cousins playing in the water. Our hearts are filled with happiness and joy with the coming of a New year.
