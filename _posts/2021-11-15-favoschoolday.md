##It's Christmas Day

My favorite day in my childhood is "Christmas Day", which is celebrated every year on 23rd Dec in our school. 

On the first day of Dec, all the students along with the class teacher's names are written on chits. Everyone is allowed to take only one chit. On "Christmas Day," the student can gift anything to the other whose name he/she got in that chit. Likewise, every class in our school does the same thing. Then in the evening after 3:30 PM we started our practice on some cultural activities like dancing, singing, essay writing competition, sports, etc.

On the previous day of the event, we decorated our classrooms with different color ribbons and draw on the board using color chalks to greet everyone and also to say the meaning of the celebration. We also use to make Christmas crib and decorate it with toys related to Christmas. 

On the day of celebration, everyone is dressed up in colorful dresses, and one among the class students is dressed up as Santa Claus. At first, there would be an assembly is done with a special song, any one of the faculty members would explain the meaning of the event, and prizes are distributed to all the students who stand first in all the competitions like essay writing, sports, painting, etc.

After that, we cut a cake as Christmas day is celebrated as the birth of Jesus. All students from each class are divided into 5 members and sent to the other class to greet the other class students and their teacher with sweets without any clumsiness.  Any two or three students with their interest bring some special dishes all the students in their own class and we all have it as our lunch. Then we dance, sing, do some funny things for some time. Then we share our snacks with our friends. 
 
At last, we gift the gifts to our friends, play some time and we return to our homes by 3PM. The day would be very joyful, and we enjoyed it a lot.
