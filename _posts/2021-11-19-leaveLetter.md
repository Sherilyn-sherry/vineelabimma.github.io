##Leave Application To Manager

Subject: Requesting leave for two days from 19-11-2021 to 20-11-2021

Respected Tony,
    I am Vineela working as a Junior Web Developer in your reputed company. I like to inform you that I will not be available in the office from 19-11-2021 to 20-11-2021. As there was a celebration, that one of my friends is getting married. As it was the first marriage in our batch, for sure I must attend it. So, I request you to grant me leave on the above dates.

Thanking You,

Yours Faithfully,
Vineela Bimma
