Thanksgiving is a special habit that one should have in their life. It is also known as showing gratitude towards our things, friends, family, etc, what we have. In the United States, it is celebrated as an event. It was held on the fourth Thursday of November every year. Itâ€™s a very special holiday where everybody comes together as a family to cook, enjoy, and bless the food, but also to enjoy each other. And also forgive one another and allow them to our door.
 
As a part of this thanksgiving, first of all, I would like to thank God for the life He has given me and for protecting me and my family daily and mostly in this pandemic time. Also, I want to thank my family members mainly my two siblings and Maternal Uncle. Because they always do their best for me. They give me, support me, scold me, in everything I do whether it is right or wrong. I would also like to thank my friends I have because they played a prominent role in my life in all these years. They endured me very patiently. Nextly, I would like to thank my teachers who have helped me in my upbringing. I also want to thank the soldiers for sacrificing their lives to safeguard us.

Finally, I want to thank the gadgets I have, because they are working properly in the time I need. Like I can chat with my friends, search and learn things from various sources, click pictures, etc.
