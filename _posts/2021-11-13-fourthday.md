##How To Your First Blog

Firstly,we have to decide what to write, we must think, what we are passionate about like reading stories, articles, magazines or we can write of our life story till this day. But we need to make our minds what we will write like we must know the subject.

Secondly, we have to write a headline, and that headline must be effective.Then start writing the blog based on the headline, and we should note that the information does not go out of the topic.
When we start writing we get fear, words won't come to our mind, if we are poor in English then our fear becomes double, we also get some negative thoughts. So before we start writing or after we must take a long breathe and control ourselves.

Don't worry about English, write the sentence running in your mind and use websites like Grammarly to correct the sentence. The content must be between 500 to 1000 words, but not less than 500. We must be thorough with what we have written and read it so that we can get ideas and maintain the connection with the previous sentence.

It would be better to write the blog dividing into small paragraphs rather than like big content. We can also add images, bullet points for better understanding, and use the proper format of lettering.  We should always write a blog thinking that we are the readers. We should end up with a good ending.

At last, we must add some information like share it with others, give a review, etc.
