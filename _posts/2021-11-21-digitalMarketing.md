##Online Marketing

In the modern era, with the updating of technology, everything is becoming digital. There was a time when traditional marketing, like banner ads on roads, announcing, distributing pamphlets, was an effective marketing strategy. But nowadays, it has almost vanished. Digital marketing has replaced traditional marketing completely. 

Digital marketing is, as the word suggests, the use of the Internet to market products. There are multiple websites like Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart, etc., where people can buy products. This applies to products such as clothes, technical tools, groceries, medicines, food, and so much more. So that one doesn’t have to leave the house if one doesn’t want to. 

The challenge is for the right information of the right products to reach the people. This is where digital marketing comes in. Through data mining, it is easy for marketers to target the right people with the right advertisement of products that they might need, like YouTube and Instagram subscriptions. This is what makes online marketing successful more than anything. Finding and targeting the right people can increase sales fastly. Some tools can be used to analyze and suggest better options for marketing as well. This helps sellers market their products. 

Even nowadays we can consult doctors online, learn music, technologies and later everything becomes digital.
