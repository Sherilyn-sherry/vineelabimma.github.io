##How we can save our Enviroment.

Today I am going to write about Saving Our enviroment.

The environment is the surroundings in which we live. But the contamination of our environment by pollutants is environmental pollution. The current stage of the earth that we are seeing is the cause of the exploitation of the earth and its resources.

Moreover, the earth cannot restore its balance because of environmental pollution. We the human has created and destroyed life on earth. Human plays a vital role in the degradation of the environment. Environmental pollution, directly and indirectly, affects the lives of humans and other species. 
Types of pollutions:
Water Pollution
Air Pollution
Land Pollution
Noise Pollution 

Water Pollution:
We use water for many purposes like drinking, washing, agriculture, industries, and domestics uses in our day-to-day life. All the used water is gets contaminated is called wastewater. Throwing insoluble things like plastic bottles, covers, etc, into the water is also a primary reason for contamination. Due to this, the water gets stuck in one place, forming layers on the top of the water, which causes problems of inhaling and exhaling gases to aquatic animals. Besides, these water bodies ultimately connect to the sea which means it indirectly pollutes the Biodiversity of the Sea.

Air Pollution:
Air pollution is a mixture of different types of gases in the air. Carbon and dust particles string up with the air in the form of smog, damaging the respiratory system. These gases are released from vehicles, burning of fuels and crackers, factories, sprayers, etc. This causes Global warming which results in earthquakes, tornadoes, climatic changes that brings problems to both humans and other species. Besides, it also affects the body system and body organs of humans and birds which becomes a carrier of viruses and infections.

Land Pollution: 
Land pollutions occur when waste is not disposed of properly. The main reason for it is human activities and their misuse of land resources like the use of pesticides, fertilizers, soil erosion, and crop residues. And tons of waste from domestic, homes, offices, industries are dumped into the land.
Because of contaminated soil, the crop or agricultural produce also gets toxic. Besides, this contaminated food affects our health and organs.

Noise Pollution:
Noise Pollution is also known as Sound Pollution. It is an invisible danger. It is generated through household sounds, Traffic, fireworks, animal sounds, loudspeakers, generators, construction, industries, explosions, gunfire, thunderstorms, etc.  Disturbance of sleep, hypertension, aggressive behavior, or stress can be associated with excessive sound levels. Besides, the high-intensity sound can cause an increase in heartbeat rate and blood pressure as well.

How to Minimize Environmental Pollution?

To minimize this issue, some preventive measures need to be taken.
Principle of 3R’s: To save the environment, use the principle of 3 R’s; Reuse, Reduce and Recycle. 
Reuse: Reuse products again and again. Instead of throwing away things after one use, find a way to use them again. Reduce the generation of waste products. 
Recycle: Paper, plastics, glass, and electronic items can be processed into new products while using fewer natural resources and lesser energy.
To prevent and control air pollution, better-designed equipment, and smokeless fuels should be used in homes and industries. More and more trees should be planted to balance the ecosystem and control greenhouse effects.
Reduce: Noise pollution can be minimized by better design and proper maintenance of vehicles. Industrial noise can be reduced by soundproofing equipment like generators, etc. 
To control land pollution, we must stop the usage of plastic. Sewage should be treated properly before using it as fertilizers and as landfills. Encourage organic farming as this process involves the use of biological materials and avoiding synthetic substances to maintain soil fertility and ecological balance.
Several measures can be adopted to control water pollution. Some of them are water consumption and usage that can be minimized by altering the techniques involved. Water should be reused with treatment.

Conclusion

It is the responsibility of every individual to save our planet from these environmental contamination agents. If preventive measures are not taken then our future generation will have to face major problems. The government is also taking steps to create public awareness. Every individual should be involved in helping to reduce and control pollution. "Atleast Plant Trees on your Birthdays as  gift to earth".
