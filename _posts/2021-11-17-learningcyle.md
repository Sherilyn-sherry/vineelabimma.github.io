##How I learned riding a Bicycle.

I know learning to ride a bicycle is a big challenge in many of our lives. Today I am going to share how I learned it.

It was the summer holidays. I did not remember the year exactly, but I can say that it was my 5th grade. It was the time we have our first bicycle surprisingly gifted by my mother's brother. We are three siblings elder sister, elder brother, and me. My sister and brother already know how to ride a bicycle. They learned it by borrowing from neighbor's. So, as soon as the cycle came to our house we are very excited and can't wait to ride it. As they already know they started riding it one after the other taking turns. I am just watching them and I wish to ride.

The next day they started riding so early as it was a new one. That time also I am doing the same just watching because I am afraid of running it. In the evening, my sister asked me if I would ride it, saying that she and my brother would hold it back. Then I got little courage and said okay . 

They are holding back and I started riding slowly without looking back having trust in them. After a while, my sister shouted from far that they left the cycle. That's all my cycle went into a thorny bush. I was full of wounds cant get up, the cycle handle turned in reverse and it was on me. Fastly they came running towards me and got me up. In the night thinking about it,I got little confidence that I can ride it easily.

The next day, I was the first one to ride the cycle. Even though I have fear, controlling it and building up my confidence level I started riding it. while riding it slowly shinning up and down, suddenly a man came on his motorcycle, that's all my cycle went into a grandmother's house nearby. I got more scoldings from her and other ones too. Like that, so many strange things happened and I too have lots of hurts on my body and cycle too.

Finally, I can say that learning and riding a bicycle is an awesome feeling because it was the first vehicle that everyone has ridden it at least once.
