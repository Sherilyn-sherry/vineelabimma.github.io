My name is Vineela. My Dream Job is to become an Arts and Crafts making. I am mostly interested in this because I love to make crafts and decorative things in my home from my childhood onwards. And I also like to paint pots, draw village-style atmosphere, making greeting cards for friends and flowers. The main reason is that while doing such things my brain will be at peace and pleasant. And also get many ideas how to decorate the things even more beautiful than before. While making crafts it includes lots of work like paper cutting with exact shape and suitable colors papers etc. 
But My parents' dream is to see me as an engineer. So I accept their intention heartfully. Also becoming an engineer is also my second dream as I want to design games. To be frank, I am very poor at coding, so I cannot able to put more interest on the software side as I kept on my dream job. But I did not leave my passion ...Still when I am free I used to work on it.
